        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>We built this website to address the issue regarding the vast amount of clubs and events going on the campus, which were hard to keep track of. We made this website to reduce the spam groups on WhatsApp, which were a headache to everyone. Our website aims to provide a one-stop solution by giving a platform to all the clubs so that their events can be accessible to everyone in one place.</p>
